In my project, I embarked on creating a video conferencing application leveraging the
domain of Web Technology. By incorporating both Frontend and Backend elements, I
ensured the comprehensive functionality and success of our endeavour.
Web technology encompasses the process of constructing and managing websites, web
applications, and digital products accessible over the internet. This undertaking entails a series
of stages, including planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and ongoing
maintenance. Within the realm of web development, I distinguish two primary categories:
Frontend development and Backend development.
Frontend development revolves around crafting the user interface (UI) and enhancing the user
experience (UX) of a website or application. This involves designing visually appealing
layouts, implementing interactive elements, and optimizing responsiveness across various
devices. Conversely, Backend development focuses on building the server-side logic and
integrating databases to power the functionality of the website or application. It entails
managing data storage, processing user requests, and ensuring seamless interactions between
the frontend and backend components.
In essence, web technology entails the creation of dynamic and engaging online experiences
through the utilization of diverse programming languages, frameworks, and tools. Through
my project, I aimed to harness the potential of web development to deliver a robust and
user-friendly video conferencing solution.
